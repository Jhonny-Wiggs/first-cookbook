                <H1>MY PERSONAL <span>REFLECTION</span></H1>
                <p>
                    Throughout making the cookbook website, I just want to say that it is really draining. I get to learn new new things, especially the elements and properties in CSS which helped me shape the ideal website that I was going to have in mind. But sadly I was lacking a bit more functionalities. Since time was short and deadline was fast approaching, I didn't get a chance to apply Javascript in my website to provide the functionalities that I need for this website. The reason for why I have added an reflection button and hyperlink is because I simply want to express what I have been throughout making this project, and to come and share what I have learned and understand. I simply cannot go simple and easy on projects like these because if I do, I cannot further see what I am capable of in terms of my limits and my potential in doing these kinds of projects. That's why with a little assessment of myself, I can see what I lack or even what I need to improve. So that's all for my short reflection of this whole cookbook website project. May God Bless to the ones viewing this website!!
